# Personalized Financial Advice Chatbot Using NLP

Abstract:

This project introduces a novel approach to address the user confusion and information overload experienced on bank websites by proposing a Personalized Financial Advice Chatbot (PFAC). Traditional bank websites often suffer from complex navigation structures with numerous submenus, leading to user frustration in locating relevant information. PFAC aims to mitigate this issue by employing advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques to provide tailored financial advice and answers to user queries. By understanding user intents and preferences, PFAC streamlines the information-seeking process, enhancing user experience and facilitating better financial decision-making.
